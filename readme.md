## üìù Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a `presentation_MAPLA` on the **Constrained Sampling Problem**. The project introduces two key algorithms:

1. **Projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC)**  
    A method for solving constrained sampling problems using Langevin dynamics, consisting of performing a Langevin step followed by a projection onto the support of the target, which is a convex set.   
2. **Metropolis-Adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm (MAPLA)**  
      An advanced approach that enhances the efficiency of Langevin dynamics through preconditioning and Metropolis adjustments. Specifically, we precondition the Langevin algorithm by introducing a metric that accounts for the geometry of the support, and we apply a Metropolis filter to correct the Markov chain produced by the resulting dynamics.

The experiments related to **PLMC** are available in the notebook `PLMC`.
