## 📝 Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains a presentation on the **Constrained Sampling Problem**. The project introduces two key algorithms:

1. **Projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC)**  
   A method for solving constrained sampling problems using Langevin dynamics.
   
2. **Metropolis-Adjusted Preconditioned Langevin Algorithm (MAPLA)**  
   An advanced approach that enhances the efficiency of Langevin dynamics through preconditioning and Metropolis adjustments.

The experiments related to **PLMC** are available in the notebook `PLMC`.
